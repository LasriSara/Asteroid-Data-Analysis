# Asteroid Data Analysis

This project performs data analysis on NASA asteroid data using Python. It involves cleaning, processing, and visualizing the data to identify key patterns and insights about asteroids. The analysis includes filtering, statistical processing, and generating dynamic visualizations using various Python libraries.

## Project Overview

The dataset used in this project contains information on near-Earth asteroids from NASA's asteroid database. The analysis focuses on asteroid characteristics such as their size, velocity, distance from Earth, and impact potential. The project visualizes the data using graphs and plots to provide insights into asteroid distribution and other key statistics.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating visualizations (graphs, charts).
- **Scipy**: For performing statistical analysis and processing.
- **CSV**: For handling data input and output.

## Features

- **Data filtering**: Clean the dataset by filtering irrelevant or erroneous data.
- **Statistical processing**: Perform basic statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation) on asteroid data.
- **Visualization**: Generate dynamic graphs such as histograms, scatter plots, and time-series to represent the data visually.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
